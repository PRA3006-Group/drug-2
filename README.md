- The website's stylesheet may not run correctly when opening the webpage --> Fix this by closing everything, opening the stylesheet, then re-opening the homepage.
- Running the website from an unextracted zip file may lead to issues with switching between pages from the navigation bar - please extract the downloaded zip file before opening the files
